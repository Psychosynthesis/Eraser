## Tracking URL Params Remover
This is browser extension for removing a lot of tracking query params from URLs before they load.

For now, the full list of query params that get stripped out of URLs are:
 - "utm_campaign"
 - "utm_content"
 - "utm_id"
 - "utm_source"
 - "utm_medium"
 - "utm_term"
 - "utm_name"
 - "fbclid"
 - "gclid"

### Firefox installation
Available on addons.mozilla.org

### Chrome / Chromium installation
1. Menu -> "More Tools" -> Extensions menu
2. Toggle Developer mode on
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Click and "Open" on the folder of the add-on you want to install in dev mode

This should stay installed even when exiting/restarting.
Might get a notification pop up warning you about dev-mode though.
Going to look into getting this on the Chrome store soon.
